### Editing a Workspace

To edit an existing workspace:

   - Once inside the project, locate and click on the **"View Workspaces"** menu in the sidebar.
   - From the list of workspaces, select the workspace you want to edit.

2. **Open the Edit Workspace Form:**
   - Click on the **Edit Workspace** icon next to the selected workspace.
   - This will open the **Edit Workspace** form, which is pre-populated with the existing details of the workspace.

3. **Update the Workspace Details:**
   - Modify any of the following fields as needed:
     - Workspace **Name** and **Description**.
     - **Terraform Version**.
     - **Variables and Secrets**.

4. **Save Changes:**
   - After making the necessary updates, click **Save** to apply the changes.

> **Note:** The Edit Workspace form is identical to the Create Workspace form, with all fields pre-filled with the workspace's current details.
